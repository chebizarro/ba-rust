# Rust Implementation of Bioinformatics Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of the exercises in the [Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/) book and the [Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I started this project in order to learn both Rust and Bioinformatics. There is a companion blog which is in development.

As tempting as it might be to just copy and paste my code in order to solve the course problems, you should really attempt them youself first, as you won't really be learning anything otherwise.

If you have any suggestions for how these implementations could be improved, feel free to submit an issue or even better, a pull request.
